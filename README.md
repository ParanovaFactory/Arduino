# Arduino Sensor & Module Scripts

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Arduino scripts designed for learning, prototyping, and experimenting with a wide variety of electronic components and modules. It serves both as a personal learning archive and as a resource for others working with embedded systems, IoT prototypes, or hardware interfacing using Arduino.

## ðŸ”§ Component Categories

The scripts in the `/Script` folder are written to interact with the following module and sensor categories:

- **LEDs & Displays**: 1-Digit & 4-Digit 7-Segment Displays, RGB LEDs, MAX7219 Module, LCD1602
- **Sensors**: DHT11, Flame, Sound, Vibration, Obstacle Avoidance, IR, Ultrasonic, Temperature, Hall Magnetic, Light, Water Level, Finger Pulse
- **Input Devices**: Joystick, Keypad, Rotary Encoder, PS2 Joystick, Push Buttons, Tilt Switch
- **Actuators**: SG90 Servo Motor, Stepper Motor with ULN2003 Driver, Relays, Buzzers (Active/Passive)
- **Interfaces**: RFID Module (RC522), IR Receiver, RTC Module, IÂ²C and SPI-driven components
- **Other Modules**: Logic ICs (L293D, 74HC595), Power Supply Modules, Prototype Expansion Board

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

Each script typically demonstrates:
- Component initialization and setup
- Pin configuration and wiring guide (in code comments)
- Real-time data reading or actuation logic
- Basic control algorithms (timing, thresholds, etc.)

You can use these individually or combine them to build more complex systems like:
- Security alarms
- Environmental monitoring dashboards
- Automation systems
